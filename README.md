Code&me:

Hi I am Afr and I am starting in my coding journey. To push myself to learn new things I created this repository to host a Webpage called Code&me,
-you can find It at: https://2afr.github.io/github.io/index

Projects:

If you visited the URL you may have noticed that in the projects tab there isn´t much going around, actually nothing at all, except for Code&me I don´t have any other projects
but I would apreciate If you left some projects recommendations for me that I could do as beginner to learn more about the world of coding.

Stack:

I work with JS and Python. I use vanilla for both, but I know a framework can be super useful towards creating an application,
so in adittion with the project recommendation let me know too what framework should I use to built It.
